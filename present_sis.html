- Great art project which had all attendees mark their height on a wall, until the names covered each other up.
- Data is made up of individuals, and measurement based care will fail if it does not make information meaningful at the individual level as well as in the aggregate.
- During the presentation, we will: a) discuss principles informing the use of individual assessment data to inform decisions at the system, provider and individual levels of focus; b) summarize some initial, interactive analyses made available for exploration of SIS data; and c) review findings from statewide survey and focus groups regarding the uses of SIS data. Participants will be able to: 1. Describe

# ✋ Why measure?

???

- People often talk as if measurement is dehumanizing, but it's an ancient activity
- Since ancient Babylon/Egypt
- Length was first measured with the body itself (forearm, hand, or finger)
- It is one of the ways we relate to the world we live in

# ≋ We change. 

### *We pencil marks on doorways to track our growth, and then our children’s growth. We want to change for the better, to know that we are moving toward our goals.*

???

- If we didn't change, there would be little need to measure.
- Even in a habilitative context, there are changes in supports, preferences, personal priorities.

# ♻ We are habitual. 

### *We fall into patterns, both beautiful and destructive. Math is the science of patterns and analyzing these can help us to understand ourselves.*

???

- A wise approach to working with populations balances hope for the future with a realistic look at the past.
- If we know that people will continue to have similar clusters of concerns, how can be be forward thinking in preparing the provider network to meet their needs?
- Need to understand habits to manage change.  **If you are trying to change weight/spending/etc. do you (a) stop measuring it or (b) measure it more purposefully?**
- Example: people with aging parents.  What clusters of needs do they have and is the provider network equipped to provide for and coordinate those needs?

# ◎ We are curious

### *We want to know the causes of things; how they fit together. We want our knowledge to be concrete, to be tangible.*

???

- We cannot settle for the simple account which bleaches out the complexities of our experiences.
- We love stories, but we want to be able to multiply those stories to make needs tangible to legislators and others who allocate resources for supports and services
- Not content with anecdotes alone, we seek other objective ways of understanding the impact of our lives' work

# ☍ We are relational

### *We exist in context, in proportion. We share stories about our similar experiences. We want to measure ourselves against each other and against our own pasts.*

???

- Benchmarking, analysis of variance, clustering: any of these is just a fancy term for admitting that we understand ourselves in relationship to others.
- Each piece of data exists and gains meaning in relationship to others.  The department's communication to date on how the data should not be used basically boils down to "don't use it by itself" *Inappropriate Use of Assessments and Screening Tools (Letter to PIHP Executive Directors)*.  These are:

* As an arbitrary methodology for determining the amount, scope, and duration of community living supports and skill building services implemented outside of a person-centered planning process.
* As a means for achieving budget reductions
* As a process which supplants use of medical necessity criteria for evaluating the need for community living supports, skill building, and other supports and services.

# How are you using assessment data?

*(find a neighbor and share)*

???
Find someone you don't know well

# ⏪  How we got here

???

- History of Assessment (think DSM-1 era, very clinician centered, low reliability)
- Current psychosocial is often histories
- Most common measures have been physical: used in PT, OT
- SIS moves field into a more sophisticated approach to assessment, allowing real-world needs to be integrated into a structured assessment process

It also serves as common terminology, which can lead to:
- better communication (e.g. **imagine new supports coordinator inheriting caseload**)
- greater equity (e.g. **if diagnosis is left to personal bias it has historically varied based on race, gender, etc.**)

## Including 



The *Supports Intensity Scale* assessment includes the following areas: Medical Supports, Behavioral Supports, Home Living, Community Living, Lifelong Learning, Employment, Health and Safety, Social Activities, Protection and Advocacy

Here's a list of all the fields in each area:

???

- Quote from neurologist Oliver Sacks' essays on autism

Reality check: 
- an assessment cannot encapsulate an entire person
- Assessors role is an objective, point-in-time picture [viz: photograph]

- Yet we must act to support people based on knowledge that is always partial, yet growing
- Assessment should be practical and applied rather than put on a shelf

### *story into action*

???

- Understanding is not enough if it is not used to help
- Linking history/observation to action... 
- Creates common language that frames history and helps to imagine a future for the person

Different roles across the system will have different uses for the data:
- in Person-Centered Planning
- in Benefit Management
- to Assure Service Access and Equity
- to Understand Population-level Needs
- in Advocacy efforts

???

- Can focus on items endorsed by the person and their supports as important
- Consider how closely these are aligned with scope, intensity, duration
- Could use relevant areas to prompt consideration of potential referrals to PT, nursing, OT, etc.

- What if we could identify the geographic areas where people with a certain set of needs were clustered, so that we could build services to be more easily accessible to the people who need them?

### *All models are wrong... some are useful.*

- *All models are wrong*: a simplication of reality
- How many of you have used a map?
- The chart shows a simple generalization (linear model, depicted by line) of how a group of people (depicted by points) are related to each other based on scores across 2 measures (x-axis, y-axis)
- Yet we can see that, while some individuals fit this generalization, some are farther away from it (marked in red)
- Not all individuals fit into our ideas / preconceptions
- BUT, using data is a way of keeping our ideas accountable to the facts
- Would you rather draw a line at random, based on your own preconceptions?

# Data ~~Driven~~ Informed

The assessment does **not** prescribe:

- What do you want for your life?
- Which staff members will support you? 
- Which types of services do you choose to meet these needs?
- What setting should services be provided in?

--

*In short*: it is meant to be used **by** people, **not** instead of people

# Initial Exploratory Analyses

- [App available here](https://tbdsolutions.shinyapps.io/exploreSIS_node_mdhhs/)
- [Tutorials here](https://youtu.be/voEbIXUQ-Xg?list=PLrqpLq7US2q123PQozqis_WTQ5WGpEjvY)

Caveats: 

- This is a prototype
- Exploratory, not confirmatory (these do not **prove** anything)
- Exploration should always be guided by a defined question!
- Not a complete dataset
- There are many **more questions** than the ones that led to these...
