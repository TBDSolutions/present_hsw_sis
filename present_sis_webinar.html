# Use the Data...

.large[
MDHHS-BHDDA has identified several broad areas for use of assessment data:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

* in **Person-Centered Planning**
* in **Benefit Management**
* to **Assure Service Access and Equity**
* to **Understand Population-level Needs**
* in **Advocacy efforts**

Different roles have different uses.

[1] *See detailed discussion in white paper on [Uses of Assessment Data to Inform Services and Supports for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities](http://www.tbdsolutions.com/papers-presentations-2/)
]*

???

**Person-centered planning:**
- Recommend individual support needs to inform an individualized plan of service (IPOS)
- Identify potential goals and objectives for inclusion in the IPOS
- Identify potential referrals for additional assessments or relevant services
- Help guide safety planning by identifying areas of risk
- Design an individualized menu of services to support an individual to live independently in the community
- Identify individual strengths for inclusion in the IPOS
- Provide guidance regarding supports which may provide alternatives to guardianship
- Identify areas of specific personal interest or areas on which the individual wishes to focus

**Benefit management:**

- Inform the development of provider network service offerings.
- Evaluate provider network adequacy relative to the specific needs of the population in a given area.
- Identify locations to make services available for individuals within an accessible distance from their homes.
- Forecast needs for services not yet available.
- Provide consistently-formatted guidance to service providers related to the scope, duration and intensity of services authorized by the IPOS.
- Assist providers to develop an enhanced array of services to support compliance with the HCBS Final Rule.

**Equity of access:**

- Ensure people receive the services they need
- Identify services inconsistent with assessed needs
- Inform the prioritization of access to available waiver slots

# Don't Use it to...

MDHHS-BHDDA has clarified several uses of the resulting data which are not permitted.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  These are:

* .large[**Go Outside of PCP Process.**] As an arbitrary methodology for determining the amount, scope, and duration of community living supports and skill building services implemented outside of a person-centered planning process.
* .large[**Reduce Budgets.**] As a means for achieving budget reductions.
* .large[**Replace Medical Necessity Criteria.**] As a process which supplants use of medical necessity criteria for evaluating the need for community living supports, skill building, and other supports and services.

# What's in the data? 



The *Supports Intensity Scale* assessment includes the following areas: Medical Supports, Behavioral Supports, Home Living, Community Living, Lifelong Learning, Employment, Health and Safety, Social Activities, Protection and Advocacy

Here's a list of all the fields in each area:

# Exploring the data

The initial analyses available include:

- .large[**Productivity.**] Rate of assessment completion compared to implementation date.
- .large[**Population Summary, Medical/Behavioral.**] Summary of scores across the major sections of the assessment tool.
- .large[**Patterns of Need.**] Identify groups of people with similar combinations of needs.
- .large[**Use in Planning.**] Sample views to inform use of assessment data in individual planning.

You can filter by *PIHP*, *CMHSP* and *Date Range*.

???

Caveats: 

- This is a prototype
- Exploratory, not confirmatory (these do not **prove** anything)
- Exploration should always be guided by a defined question!
- Not a complete dataset
- There are many **more questions** than the ones that led to these...
