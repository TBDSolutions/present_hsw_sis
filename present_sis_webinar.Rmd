# Today's webinar will:

.large[
1. Discuss principles for use of assessment data 
2. Navigate interactive analyses of SIS data
3. Summarize details of analyses 
4. Answer questions
]

*Note:* While access to today's webinar has been shared with various stakeholders to promote transparency, its intended purpose is technical training for PIHP/CMH employees.

Please jot down any questions you have during the webinar and submit them in the attendee control panel.

# Use the Data...

.large[
MDHHS-BHDDA has identified several broad areas for use of assessment data:<sup>1</sup>

- <i class="fa fa-street-view"></i> in **Person-Centered Planning**
-  <i class="fa fa-credit-card"></i> in **Benefit Management**
- <i class="fa fa-balance-scale"></i> to **Assure Service Access and Equity**
- <i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i> to **Understand Population-level Needs**
- <i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> in **Advocacy efforts**
]

.footnote[
[1] *See detailed discussion in white paper on [Uses of Assessment Data to Inform Services and Supports for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities](http://www.tbdsolutions.com/papers-presentations-2/)
]*

???

Different roles require different uses of data.
And different interpretations of it (*e.g. weather data interpreted by a farmer, bike messenger, tourist*)

**Person-centered planning:**
- Recommend individual support needs to inform an individualized plan of service (IPOS)
- Identify potential goals and objectives for inclusion in the IPOS
- Identify potential referrals for additional assessments or relevant services
- Help guide safety planning by identifying areas of risk
- Design an individualized menu of services to support an individual to live independently in the community
- Identify individual strengths for inclusion in the IPOS
- Provide guidance regarding supports which may provide alternatives to guardianship
- Identify areas of specific personal interest or areas on which the individual wishes to focus

**Benefit management:**

- Inform the development of provider network service offerings.
- Evaluate provider network adequacy relative to the specific needs of the population in a given area.
- Identify locations to make services available for individuals within an accessible distance from their homes.
- Forecast needs for services not yet available.
- Provide consistently-formatted guidance to service providers related to the scope, duration and intensity of services authorized by the IPOS.
- Assist providers to develop an enhanced array of services to support compliance with the HCBS Final Rule.

**Equity of access:**

- Ensure people receive the services they need
- Identify services inconsistent with assessed needs
- Inform the prioritization of access to available waiver slots

# Don't Use it to...

MDHHS-BHDDA has clarified several uses of the resulting data which are not permitted.<sup>1</sup>  These are:

* .large[<i class="fa fa-ban"></i> **Go Outside of PCP Process.**] As an arbitrary methodology for determining the amount, scope, and duration of community living supports and skill building services implemented outside of a person-centered planning process.
* .large[<i class="fa fa-ban"></i> **Reduce Budgets.**] As a means for achieving budget reductions.
* .large[<i class="fa fa-ban"></i> **Replace Medical Necessity Criteria.**] As a process which supplants use of medical necessity criteria for evaluating the need for community living supports, skill building, and other supports and services.

# What's in the data? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
needs <- read.csv("C:/Users/joshh/Documents/GitHub/exploreSIS_node_mshn/data/needs.csv")
```

The *Supports Intensity Scale* assessment includes the following areas: `r paste(unique(needs$section_desc),sep = '',collapse = ', ')`

Here's a list of all the fields in each area:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
needs %>%
  select(section_desc, item_desc) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    rownames = FALSE,
    colnames = c('Section Name','Item Name'),
    fillContainer = FALSE, 
    extensions = 'Scroller',
    options = list(#pageLength = 5, 
                   dom = 't',
                   deferRender = F,
                   scrollY = 200,
                   scroller = TRUE))
```

???

Around 500 data points.

Compared with other common data sources, e.g. claims:
- More detailed (allows much deeper view into individual needs and attributes than a claim)
- Less frequent (requires thoughtful interpretation of items that change, such as *important to/for*)

# Exploring the data

The initial analyses available include:

- .large[<i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i> **Productivity.**] Rate of assessment completion compared to implementation date.
- .large[<i class="fa fa-users"></i> **Population Summary.**] Summary of scores across the major sections of the assessment tool. Includes *Medical/Behavioral* section.
- .large[<i class="fa fa-cubes"></i> **Patterns of Need.**] Identify groups of people with similar combinations of needs.
- .large[<i class="fa fa-street-view"></i> **Use in Planning.**] Sample views to inform use of assessment data in individual planning.

You can filter by *PIHP*, *CMHSP* and *Date Range*.

???

Caveats: 

- This is a prototype
- Exploratory, not confirmatory (these do not **prove** anything)
- Exploration should always be guided by a defined question!
- Not a complete dataset
- There are many **more questions** than the ones that led to these...
