- Great art project which had all attendees mark their height on a wall, until the names covered each other up.
- Data is made up of individuals, and measurement based care will fail if it does not make information meaningful at the individual level as well as in the aggregate.

# ✋ Why measure?

???

- People often talk as if measurement is dehumanizing, but it's an ancient activity
- Since ancient Babylon/Egypt
- Length was first measured with the body itself (forearm, hand, or finger)
- It is one of the ways we relate to the world we live in

# ≋ We change. 

### *We pencil marks on doorways to track our growth, and then our children’s growth. We want to change for the better, to know that we are moving toward our goals.*

???

- If we didn't change, there would be little need to measure.
- Even in a habilitative context, there are changes in supports, preferences, personal priorities.

# ♻ We are habitual. 

### *We fall into patterns, both beautiful and destructive. Math is the science of patterns and analyzing these can help us to understand ourselves.*

???

- A wise approach to working with populations balances hope for the future with a realistic look at the past.
- If we know that people will continue to have similar clusters of concerns, how can be be forward thinking in preparing the provider network to meet their needs?
- Need to understand habits to manage change.  **If you are trying to change weight/spending/etc. do you (a) stop measuring it or (b) measure it more purposefully?**
- Example: people with aging parents.  What clusters of needs do they have and is the provider network equipped to provide for and coordinate those needs?

# ◎ We are curious

### *We want to know the causes of things; how things fit together. We want our knowledge to be concrete, to be tangible.*

???

- We love stories, but we want to be able to multiply those stories to make needs tangible to legislators and others who allocate resources for supports and services
- Not content with anecdotes alone, we seek other objective ways of understanding the impact of our lives' work

### *We exist in context, in proportion. We share stories about our similar experiences. We want to measure ourselves against each other and against our own pasts.*

???

- Benchmarking, analysis of variance, clustering: any of these is just a fancy term for admitting that we understand ourselves in relationship to others.

# ⏪  How we got here

???

- History of Assessment (think DSM-1 era, very clinician centered, low reliability)
- Current psychosocial is often histories
- Most common measures have been physical: used in PT, OT
- SIS moves field into a more sophisticated approach to assessment, allowing real-world needs to be integrated into a structured assessment process

Common terminology can lead to:
- better communication (e.g. **imagine new supports coordinator inheriting caseload**)
- greater equity (e.g. **if diagnosis is left to personal bias it has historically varied based on race, gender, etc.**)

- Quote from neurologist Oliver Sacks essays on autism

Reality check: 
- an assessment cannot encapsulate an entire person
- Assessors role is an objective, point-in-time picture [viz: photograph]

- Yet we must act to support people based on knowledge that is always partial, yet growing
- Assessment should be practical and applied rather than put on a shelf

### *story into action*

???

- Understanding is not enough if it is not used to help
- Linking history/observation to action... 
- Creates common language that frames history and helps to imagine a future for the person
- Let's look at a few examples...

## Data ~~Driven~~ Informed

### *All models are wrong... some are useful.*

- *All models are wrong*: a simplication of reality
- How many of you have used a map?
- The chart shows a simple generalization (linear model, depicted by line) of how a group of people (depicted by points) are related to each other based on scores across 2 measures (x-axis, y-axis)
- Yet we can see that, while some individuals fit this generalization, some are farther away from it (marked in red)
- Not all individuals fit into our ideas / preconceptions
- BUT, using data is a way of keeping our ideas accountable to the facts
- Would you rather draw a line at random, based on your own preconceptions?

## Data ~~Driven~~ Informed

The assessment does **not** prescribe:

- Which staff members will support the person? 
- Which supports should help meet these needs?
- What setting should services be provided in?

--

*In short*: it is meant to be used **by** people, **not** instead of people

???

- Can focus on items endorsed by the person and their supports as important
- Consider how closely these are aligned with scope, intensity, duration
- Could use relevant areas to prompt consideration of potential referrals to PT, nursing, OT, etc.
