# Why measure?

???

- People often talk as if measurement is dehumanizing, but it's an ancient activity
- Since ancient Babylon/Egypt
- Length was first measured with the body itself (forearm, hand, or finger)
- It is one of the ways we relate to the world we live in

## We change. 

*We pencil marks on doorways to track our growth, and then our children’s growth. We want to change for the better, to know that we are moving toward our goals.*

# ♻
## We are habitual. 

*We fall into patterns, both beautiful and destructive. Math is the science of patterns and analyzing these can help us to understand ourselves.*

# ◎
## We are curious

*We want to know the causes of things; how things fit together. We want our knowledge to be concrete, to be tangible.*

# ☍
## We are relational

*We exist in context, in proportion. We share stories about our similar experiences. We want to measure ourselves against each other and against our own pasts.*

&gt; ### for clinical diagnosis, if we hope to 
&gt; ### understand the... individual, nothing 
&gt; ### less than a total biography will do.

### *story into action*

???

- Understanding is not enough if it is not used to help
- Linking history/observation to action... 
- Creates common language that frames history and helps to imagine a future for the person
- Assessors role is an objective, point-in-time picture [viz: photograph]

## Data ~~Driven~~ Informed

The assessment does **not** prescribe:

- Which staff members will support the person? 
- Which supports should help meet these needs?
- What setting should services be provided in?
