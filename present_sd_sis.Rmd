# Why measure?

???

- People often talk as if measurement is dehumanizing, but it's an ancient activity
- Since ancient Babylon/Egypt
- Length was first measured with the body itself (forearm, hand, or finger)
- It is one of the ways we relate to the world we live in

# ≋
## We change. 

*We pencil marks on doorways to track our growth, and then our children’s growth. We want to change for the better, to know that we are moving toward our goals.*

???

- If we didn't change, there would be little need to measure.
- Even in a habilitative context, there are changes in supports, preferences, personal priorities.

# ♻
## We are habitual. 

*We fall into patterns, both beautiful and destructive. Math is the science of patterns and analyzing these can help us to understand ourselves.*

???

- A wise approach to working with populations balances hope for the future with a realistic look at the past.
- If we know that people will continue to have similar clusters of concerns, how can be be forward thinking in preparing the provider network to meet their needs?
- Example: people with aging parents.  What clusters of needs do they have and is the provider network equipped to provide for and coordinate those needs?

# ◎
## We are curious

*We want to know the causes of things; how things fit together. We want our knowledge to be concrete, to be tangible.*

???

- We love stories, but we want to be able to multiply those stories to make needs tangible to legislators and others who allocate resources for supports and services
- Not content with anecdotes alone, we seek other objective ways of understanding the impact of our lives' work

# ☍
## We are relational

*We exist in context, in proportion. We share stories about our similar experiences. We want to measure ourselves against each other and against our own pasts.*

???

- Benchmarking, analysis of variance, clustering: any of these is just a fancy term for admitting that we understand ourselves in relationship to others.

# ⏪
## How we got here

???

- History of Assessment
- Current psychosocial is often histories
- Only measures have been in PT, OT
- SIS moves field into a more sophisticated approach to assessment, allowing real-world needs to be integrated into a structured assessment process

- Quote from neurologist Oliver Sacks essays on autism

Reality check: 
- an assessment cannot encapsulate an entire person
- Assessors role is an objective, point-in-time picture [viz: photograph]

- Yet we must act to support people based on knowledge that is always partial, yet growing
- Assessment should be practical and applied rather than put on a shelf

### *story into action*

???

- Understanding is not enough if it is not used to help
- Linking history/observation to action... 
- Creates common language that frames history and helps to imagine a future for the person
- Let's look at a few examples...

# Self-determination

includes...
- self-awareness

- *understanding patterns*
- *transform needs to hopes*
- *clearly frame options*

- Core components of self-determination... and how data from the assessment might be used to complement these...

## Including 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
needs <- read.csv("C:/Users/joshh/Documents/GitHub/exploreSIS_node_mshn/data/needs.csv")
```

The *Supports Intensity Scale* assessment includes the following areas: `r paste(unique(needs$section_desc),sep = '',collapse = ', ')`

Here's a list of all the fields in each area:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
needs %>%
  select(section_desc, item_desc) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    rownames = FALSE,
    colnames = c('Section Name','Item Name'),
    fillContainer = FALSE, 
    extensions = 'Scroller',
    options = list(#pageLength = 5, 
                   dom = 't',
                   deferRender = F,
                   scrollY = 200,
                   scroller = TRUE))
```

## Data ~~Driven~~ Informed

library(ggplot2)

d <- mtcars
fit <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = d)
d$predicted <- predict(fit)   # Save the predicted values
d$residuals <- residuals(fit) # Save the residual values

ggplot(d, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +

- *All models are wrong*: a simplication of reality
- How many of you have used a map?

- The chart shows a simple generalization (linear model, depicted by line) of how a group of people (depicted by points) are related to each other based on scores across 2 measures (x-axis, y-axis)
- Yet we can see that, while some individuals fit this generalization, some are farther away from it (marked in red)
- Not all individuals fit into our ideas / preconceptions
- BUT, using data is a way of keeping our ideas accountable to the facts

- Would you rather draw a line at random, based on your own preconceptions?

## Data ~~Driven~~ Informed

The assessment does **not** prescribe:

- Which staff members will support the person? 
- Which supports should help meet these needs?
- What setting should services be provided in?

--

*In short*: it is meant to be used **by** people, **not** instead of people

# Practical Uses

### Connecting to Person-Centered Planning
```{r eval=require('DT'), echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.height=3}
library(dplyr); library(DT); library(RColorBrewer)

DT_in <- read.csv("df.csv")
DT_in <- DT_in %>% select(-X)

DT_in %>%
  datatable(rownames = F,
            colnames = c('Area','Need','Score','Type of Support','Frequency',
                         'Daily Support Time','Important To/For'),
            fillContainer = FALSE, 
            extensions = 'Scroller',
            options = list(dom = 't',
                   deferRender = F,
                   scrollY = 200,
                   scroller = TRUE)) %>%
  formatStyle('score', color = styleInterval(c(6), c("#800026","#ffffcc")),
              backgroundColor = styleInterval(c(1:8), brewer.pal(9,"YlOrRd")))

```

???

- Can focus on items endorsed by the person and their supports as important
- Consider how closely these are aligned with scope, intensity, duration
- Could use relevant areas to prompt consideration of potential referrals to PT, nursing, OT, etc.

# Practical Uses

### Mapping locations
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet); library(dplyr)

lat <- rnorm(700, mean = 43.2, sd = 1)
lon <- rnorm(700, mean = -84.5, sd = 0.4)
geocoded <- data.frame(lat,lon) 

leaflet() %>%
  fitBounds(
    lng1 = -86,  
    lat1 = 44,
    lng2 = -85,
    lat2 = 42
  ) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addMarkers(
    data = geocoded,
    lat = ~lat, 
    lng = ~lon,
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
  )

```

???

- What if we could identify the geographic areas where people with a certain set of needs were clustered, so that we could build services to be more easily accessible to the people who need them?

# And... Focus
