# Why measure?

???

- People often talk as if measurement is dehumanizing, but it's an ancient activity
- Since ancient Babylon/Egypt
- Length was first measured with the body itself (forearm, hand, or finger)
- It is one of the ways we relate to the world we live in

## We change. 

*We pencil marks on doorways to track our growth, and then our children’s growth. We want to change for the better, to know that we are moving toward our goals.*

# ♻
## We are habitual. 

*We fall into patterns, both beautiful and destructive. Math is the science of patterns and analyzing these can help us to understand ourselves.*

# ◎
## We are curious

*We want to know the causes of things; how things fit together. We want our knowledge to be concrete, to be tangible.*

# ☍
## We are relational

*We exist in context, in proportion. We share stories about our similar experiences. We want to measure ourselves against each other and against our own pasts.*

## How we got here

???

- History of Assessment
- Current psychosocial is often histories
- Only measures have been in PT, OT
- SIS moves field into a more sophisticated approach to assessment

### *story into action*

???

- Understanding is not enough if it is not used to help
- Linking history/observation to action... 
- Creates common language that frames history and helps to imagine a future for the person
- Assessors role is an objective, point-in-time picture [viz: photograph]

## Including 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
needs <- read.csv("C:/Users/joshh/Documents/GitHub/exploreSIS_node_mshn/data/needs.csv")
```

The *Supports Intensity Scale* assessment includes the following areas: `r paste(unique(needs$section_desc),sep = '',collapse = ', ')`

Here's a list of all the fields in each area:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
needs %>%
  select(section_desc, item_desc) %>%
  DT::datatable(
    rownames = FALSE,
    colnames = c('Section Name','Item Name'),
    fillContainer = FALSE, 
    extensions = 'Scroller',
    options = list(#pageLength = 5, 
                   dom = 't',
                   deferRender = F,
                   scrollY = 200,
                   scroller = TRUE))
```

## Data ~~Driven~~ Informed

The assessment does **not** prescribe:

- Which staff members will support the person? 
- Which supports should help meet these needs?
- What setting should services be provided in?

Residuals viz: https://www.r-bloggers.com/visualising-residuals/
Not all individuals fit into our ideas / preconceptions
BUT, using data is a way of keeping our ideas accountable to the facts

# Practical Uses
- This helps you do PCP better!
- Identifying needs for individuals (e.g. potential referrals)
- Mapping locations

This is the ideal, now let's take time to understand where we are today:
- Commence focus group
