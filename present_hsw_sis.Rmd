## How measurement can fit in

- self-awareness : *understanding patterns*

- goal setting : *connect needs to hopes*

- decision making

- problem solving 

- self-advocacy : *use a common language*

## 

Measures have been with us since the dawn of culture.

## We change. {data-background=#5b7335}

We pencil marks on doorways to track our growth, and then our children’s growth. We want to change for the better, to know that we are moving toward our goals.

## We are habitual. {data-background=#536a6e}

We fall into patterns, both beautiful and destructive. Math is the science of patterns and analyzing these can help us to understand ourselves.

## We want to understand. {data-background=#3a3c21}

We want to know the causes of things; how we are broken and how we might become whole again. We want our knowledge to be concrete, to be tangible.

## We are relational. {data-background=#ab4434}

We exist in context, in proportion. We share stories about our similar experiences. We want to measure ourselves against each other and against our own pasts.

# Can we trust the data?

## Completeness

## Things data will never do...

> - push your children on the swingset
> - suffer with you through hardships
> - be beautifully, resolutely illogical

But we can use it to create more complex models of the incredible people we serve.

## We trust a lot of other things

## Stay skeptical (of yourself, too)

- Logic is a pre-requisite for using data

# Who should we help?

## Identifying prospective HSW candidates

## Caveat: Not meant to limit access

# How can we help them?

## Listen!

## Integrating assessments into Person-Centered Planning

## Finding Profiles of Need

Complexity v. Severity
severe developmental disabilities
- While we often talk about level of severity (as though a person was more like a neat pile than a regeode).  We do this because it "gets people in the door" but it is far from truly knowing someone.  (as though a handshake were the same as a friendship)
