# Overview 

## First point {data-background=#073642}

## Second point 

# Can we trust the data?

## Completeness

## Things data will never do...

> - push your children on the swingset
> - suffer with you through hardships
> - be beautifully, resolutely illogical

But we can use it to create more complex models of the incredible people we serve.

## We trust a lot of other things

## Stay skeptical (of yourself, too)

- Logic is a pre-requisite for using data

# Who should we help?

## Identifying prospective HSW candidates

## Caveat: Not meant to limit access

# How can we help them?

## Listen!

## Integrating assessments into Person-Centered Planning

## Finding Profiles of Need

Complexity v. Severity
severe developmental disabilities
- While we often talk about level of severity (as though a person was more like a neat pile than a regeode).  We do this because it "gets people in the door" but it is far from truly knowing someone.  (as though a handshake were the same as a friendship)
